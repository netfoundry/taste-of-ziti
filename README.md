# A Taste of OpenZiti

This repository is a work in progress. When complete it will contain a set of examples to support the Taste of Ziti introduction.

This repository contains a collection of samples that utilize many of the available [OpenZiti](https://github.com/openziti) SDKs. The samples provide access 
a preconfigured CloudZiti network with several dark applications already running. 

To make the getting started hurdle even lower, our CloudZiti network will generate a temporary Identity for you.

# Sample Services
The Taste-of-Ziti CloudZiti demo network contains the following test applications that you can access with the code samples in this project
* [Swagger Petstore](https://landing.openziti.io/pet-store/)
* [Postgres Database](https://landing.openziti.io/postgres-database/)
